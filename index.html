                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm a third-year student studying Software Engineering at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca">
                        University of Waterloo</a> in Ontario, Canada. Currently I am a software engineer intern at 
                        <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> working on the content serving platform.
                        Over the past couple of years I have also interned at <a href="https://tulip.io/">Tulip Retail</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.textnow.com/">TextNow</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tdlab">TD Lab</a>. 
                        You can take a look at my <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for more details on my work experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy video games, playing guitar, hiking, and aerospace. I've worked on various programming projects 
                        over the years but right now I'm particularly interested in game development; you can read about these 
                        projects below. Free feel to <a href="mailto:jerry.feng41@gmail.com">shoot me an e-mail</a> if you 
                        have any questions!

                        <h2 class="project-title">Pumpkin Kid</h2>
                        <p>
                            You find yourself in a graveyard with nothing but a shovel, and gun, and a pumpkin glowing on your head...
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="project-title">Grilled</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the wild it's meat or be meatened. With only your trusty grill keeping you afloat, you don't need to 
                            outrun the lions - you just need to outrun the other guy.

                        <p>
                            Greentext is a not-to-be-taken-very-seriously procedural programming language written in and interpreted 
                            into Python. I was inspired by this reddit thread and decided to turn the idea into reality. It features 
                            most of the basic programming constructs, such as conditional statements, loops, function calls, 
                            and recursion.
